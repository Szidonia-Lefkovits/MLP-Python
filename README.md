# Predict-Bike-Sharing
This is project for Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.

It takes data from UCI Machine Learning Database to predict bike sharing rides through a simple neural network.

### Introduction
In this project, a neural network is built from scratch. It predicts the bike-sharing rides based on historical data. The data is obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
The implemented neural network consists of a 2-layered MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). 
It helps you to build your first MPL using Python. The project guides you through the building blocks of a MPL: backpropagation (forward path, backward path), implementation of input-output values in each layer, the basic concept of training and testing a simple artificial neural network.
